Big Data analysis using the Pyspark and SQL API's of Apache Spark

<p>
This project is doing explorative data analysis using the pyspark and sql application programming interfaces (API's) of Apache spark.

The airtraffic system data records consist of the tables flights, planes,
and airports. The data sources used  are csv-files stored locally. 
The functions and methods applied here include SQL-queries and
SQL-calculations and pyspark implementations like select, filter,
collect, join, and aggregate. Those can of course applied to Big Data on remote machines. This is the whole point of the Apache Spark system architecture. It allows even analysing streaming data in real time.
